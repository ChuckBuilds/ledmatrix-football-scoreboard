## Major Refactoring: Stop Reinventing the Wheel

This release represents a complete refactoring of the football scoreboard plugin to reuse the proven, battle-tested football managers from the LEDMatrix core project instead of maintaining duplicate custom code.

### What's Changed

**🔄 Architecture Refactor**
- Replaced custom modular architecture with proven LEDMatrix managers
- Now uses battle-tested NFL and NCAA FB managers from LEDMatrix core
- Eliminated duplicate code maintenance burden

**📁 New Files Added**
- `sports.py` - SportsCore, SportsLive, SportsRecent, SportsUpcoming base classes
- `football.py` - Football and FootballLive classes with rendering
- `data_sources.py` - ESPNDataSource for API calls

**🧪 Testing & Development**
- Added comprehensive test suite (`test_football_plugin.py`)
